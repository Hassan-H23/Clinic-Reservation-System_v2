# Clinic-Reservation-System_v2

The clinic reservation system, developed in Java using the NetBeans IDE, features a multi-tiered access structure designed to cater to different user roles:

Patient Access: Patients can book and manage appointments with doctors, update their account information, view available doctors and their schedules, and make appointments with their preferred doctors.

Doctor Access: Doctors have the ability to update their schedules and fees, review their own schedules, order medical supplies, and access their revenue reports.

Admin Access: Administrators can add new doctors to the system, view orders placed by doctors, and monitor the overall revenue generated by all doctors combined.

This system streamlines clinic operations by providing tailored functionalities for each user role, ensuring efficient management of appointments, schedules, and financial tracking.

This is an improved version of CMS v1. changes include better time complexity for searching algorthims (O(N^2)->O(NlogN)), improved GUI and Database Integration into the system
